Restaurants are the heart of our communities - where we go to celebrate life’s memorable moments with those we love, and find comfort and familiarity in the world. But while the digital and data revolutions have transformed other parts of commerce and hospitality, restaurants haven’t had the same opportunity. The result has been an industry that’s - on average - had their profit margins shrink by 5x over the past 20 years.




Bikky was founded on the belief that restaurants deserve the same access to data as the largest, most sophisticated businesses in the world. We believe that data can fundamentally transform the economic model of the entire restaurant industry - producing better businesses, more jobs, and stronger communities.




Bikky is based in New York City and has raised over $15 million in funding to date, most recently with a Series A in Q4 2023. We’re proud to serve thousands of restaurant locations across the U.S., including major brands like Bojangles, MOD Pizza, Dave’s Hot Chicken, and Long John Silver’s. 




About the role




As a Data Analyst, you’ll act as the bridge between our customers and our product. You’ll support customers through their journey adopting Bikky - starting from onboarding their data all the way to leveraging it for sophisticated analyses. You’ll be a key stakeholder in making sure that our customers understand Bikky’s insights and that we become a core part of their critical decision making processes. Unlike data roles that focus on internal analyses, at Bikky you’ll work across the entire restaurant industry - helping brands use their data to solve their hardest business challenges. 




From a technical perspective, you’ll have the opportunity to contribute throughout our entire data stack. A typical day might include everything from updating a DBT model to support a new customer’s needs, to performing an analysis on customer retention. You'll collaborate closely with our product and engineering teams to refine and enhance our data tools based on real-world customer feedback. Long term, there’s an opportunity to grow into a product development, data engineering, or data science role depending on where you’d like to take your career. 




About you




Our data roles are unique; they’re product and customer facing, rather than internal facing. To meet that challenge, we’re looking for candidates with a multidisciplinary skillset. In our interview process we’ll look for analysis experience, business sense, and interpersonal skills.




The ideal candidate will have: 

1-3 years of experience working with data
Fluency in SQL, experience with DBT a bonus 
Experience in a business facing or customer facing analytical role 
Strong statistical skills
Excellent verbal and written communication




This is a great role for candidates early in their careers or transitioning into data from a business role. That said, we want to talk with exceptional candidates from any background. If you feel you’re a great fit for the role, please reach out even if you don’t meet all of the points above. 




Why us




At Bikky, you’ll work on challenging problems that matter to real businesses while tackling industry leading technical challenges. Our DBT + Snowflake implementation is in the top ~1% of industry-wide sophistication and we grapple with novel data engineering, analytical, and product problems every day. Alongside challenging work, you’ll have the support of a fully Senior and Staff level team. You’ll be the first non-senior level hire and we’re deeply committed to making sure you’ll be successful. You’ll have the opportunity to accelerate your career by working alongside some of the best in the industry. 




Perks and Benefits

$100,000 - $140,000 annual salary 
Generous equity compensation
Top tier (for stage) health insurance including medical, vision, and dental 
Ability to participate in a 401k
Bikky offers a hybrid working environment. For candidates in New York City, we have an office where teammates can opt to work 2-3 times per week.
